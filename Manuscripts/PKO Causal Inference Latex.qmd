### Introduction

-   Introduce problem of causal inference in peacebuilding research
-   Introduce methods and case
-   Preview results

### The Literature on PKOs and Peacebuilding

-   Positive Effects
-   Negative Effects
-   No Effect
-   Conditional Effects
-   Segue to Causal Research

### The State of Causal Research in the PKO Literature

-   Justify the fixation on causal research in PKO studies and note that scholars use causal language in correlative studies
-   Introduce the fundamental problem of causal inference
-   Note that these methods are used within the context of tackling endogeneity instead of making causal inferences
-   Note that matching does not solve causal inference issues
-   Note that, when matching is used, IPW is not employed
- Fixed effects is problematic because it omits controlling for valuable confounders since these confounders do not vary within-country units. And note the problems with using FE for causal inference.
-   Commentary on the use of IV regression
-   Discuss RCTs and Diff-in-diff research. Parallel trends hard to justify.
-   Segue to Synthetic Control Method

### The Synthetic Control Method

-   Introduce the SCM in the literature and what it does
-   Statistical inference with the SCM
-   Robustness checks with the SCM
-   Limitations of the SCM (see Abadie et al. 2021)

### Case Selection and Background

### Results

-   Synthetic Weights
-   Synthetic Compared to the Real
-   The Causal Effect of the PKO in X Country
-   Low-Level Death Gap Between Real and Synthetic Graph
-   Robustness Check 1: Leave-One-Out Estimation
-   Robustness Check 2: Alternative Predictors
-   Inference 1: Artificial Timing of Event (in-time placebo)
-   Inference 2: Treatment Applied to Non-Treated Units (in-space placebo) - With and Without Outliers
-   Post/Pre- MSPE Graph

### Conclusion

-   Summary of the state of causal research
-   Summary of results
-   Limits of this study
-   What Future Research Should Be
-   Policy Applicability
