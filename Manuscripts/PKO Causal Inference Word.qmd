title: "Causal Inference for Peacekeeping Research: A Synthetic Control Approach"
abstract: "\\dropcap{M}uch of the peacebuilding literture focuses on causal relationships but neglects causal methods. In many instances, talk of 'correlation' and 'association' is insufficient with the avaliability of contemporary causal inference methods. This study furthers the study of peacebuilding by analyzing the impact of a U.N. peacekeeping operation (PKO) in X. Introducing the synthetic control method to the peacekeeping literature, I find X. Given the causal effect demonstrated by this study, the results from this analysis offer important insights for policymakers."

# The Literature on PKOs and Peacebuilding

Overwhelmingly, two decades of research have suggested a general conflict-reducing effect of third-party peacekeeping operations (PKOs) (Fortna and Howard 2008, Dorussen 2014, Walter et al. 2021). Indeed, this relationship has been established across a wide variety of operationalizations of peace, such as the rule of law (Blair 2019), economic recovery (Bove et al. 2021), inter-ethnic trust (Mironova and Whitt 2015), battle deaths (Vivalt 2015), the risk of conflict onset (Hegre et al. 2018), the risk of conflict recurrence (Fortna 2004, Quinn et al. 2007, Collier et al. 2008, Mason et al. 2011), and mass killings (Melander 2009). PKOs have been theorized to promote peace through their capacities to stop ongoing violence, to prevent formerly warring parties from re-engaging in conflict, and to address structural causes of violence.

In this first aspect of peace promotion, PKOs are theorized to serve as a "buffer" between groups engaged in ongoing violence. If a physical buffer is placed between warring parties, the chances of accidental engagement between groups that might disrupt the conflict termination process decreases. For those groups that may not be committed to the conflict termination process, PKOs make the process of reneging on ceasefires much more costly as PKOs can monitor which actors are violating a ceasefire. In addition, the mere presence of a PKO serving as a buffer can eliminate tactical advantages a reneging party may have had as the element of a surprise is spoiled by PKOs who publicly report violations of ceasefires. Given that PKOs often serve as buffers, reneging parties run the risk of armed confrontation with peacekeeping forces, which itself contains international costs on reputation.

In the post-conflict environment, PKOs are thought to contribute to post-conflict peace by resolving "commitment problems". In short, the commitment problem is a dilemma scholars studying conflict have identified that makes conflict recurrence a rational path for formerly-warring actors (Fearon 1995, Hartzell et al. 2001, Powell 2006). When warring parties are ready to "come to the table" and negotiate, these parties are aware that, regardless of the settlement they reach, the other party has an incentive to renege on the settlement when it is beneficial for them to do so. Barring a third-party enforcement mechanism, formerly-warring parties may return to war either because the incentive to renege increases or, for preventative purposes, under the expectation that the other party is about to renege on the settlement. In this role, PKOs can serve as a clear third-party guarantor of a settlement to help resolve the commitment problem. Lastly, recent studies have demonstrated that PKOs can serve to resolve underlying structural forces that may promote the onset and recurrence of violence. Examples of this include studies demonstrating a positive effect of PKOs on local economic well-being (Bove et al. 2021), inter-ethnic relations (Mironova and Whitt 2015), and the promotion of representative political institutions (Joshi 2013).

However, many scholars have documented disturbing occurrences that are associated with the onset of PKOs. Indeed, a large (and growing) literature details the links between U.N. PKOs and transactional sex, sex tourism, and human trafficking (Jennings 2010, Smith and Smith 2010, Smith and de la Cuesta 2011, Beber et al. 2017, Bell et al. 2018). While sexual abuse and predation is not necessarily an indicator that a post-conflict environment will return to conflict, it is nonetheless an indicator that PKOs may contribute to post-conflict grievances. Other scholars have noted the presence of "peacekeeping economies" in which local economies experience growth *because of a PKO*, but this growth is sensitive the PKO withdrawals (Jennings and Boas 2015, Jennings 2018, Beber et al. 2019).

# The State of Causal Research in the PKO Literature

-   Justify the fixation on causal research in PKO studies and note that scholars use causal language in correlative studies
-   Introduce the fundamental problem of causal inference
-   Note that these methods are used within the context of tackling endogeneity instead of making causal inferences
-   Note that matching does not solve causal inference issues
-   Note that, when matching is used, IPW is not employed
-   Fixed effects is problematic because it omits controlling for valuable confounders since these confounders do not vary within-country units. And note the problems with using FE for causal inference.
-   Commentary on the use of IV regression and regression discontinuity.
-   Discuss RCTs and Diff-in-diff research. Parallel trends hard to justify.
-   Segue to Synthetic Control Method
